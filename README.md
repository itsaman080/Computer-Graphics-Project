# Computer-Graphics-Project
This project presents the development of a simple yet engaging Bouncing Ball 
Game using OpenGL and GLUT.
The game demonstrates fundamental concepts of computer graphics, including 
rendering, animation, and user interaction. The objective is to provide a hands-on 
experience in creating a graphical application, highlighting the use of basic physics 
for motion and collision detection. The project is implemented in C++ and uses 
OpenGL for graphics rendering and GLUT for managing windows and input 
events.
The game features a start screen where players can see the project title, team 
members, and instructions to start the game. During gameplay, a ball bounces 
within the window boundaries, and players can interact with the ball by clicking on 
it to increase its speed and score points. The ball's movement is influenced by 
gravity, represented through acceleration, making the game more realistic and 
challenging. The game ends when the ball hits the bottom of the window, 
displaying a game over screen with the final score and an option to restart the game.
This project not only showcases the technical implementation of a graphical 
game but also emphasizes the importance of user interface design and interaction. 
The report details the design, implementation, and testing phases of the project, 
along with insights into potential future enhancements such as improved graphics, 
sound effects, and additional levels. The Bouncing Ball Game serves as an 
educational tool, offering insights into the complexities of game development and 
the practical applications of computer graphics principles.
